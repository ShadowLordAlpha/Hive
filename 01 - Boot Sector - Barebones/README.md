# Hive

## Goal

Create a "program" that a BIOS can use as a boot image/disk

## Requierments

For this section there are two programs you will need. You can use others or replacements but I am on a windows computer using these so that is what my tutorials will be following.

* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/download/) - Emulation program. We will use this so that we don't brick one of our own computers by accident. Also it is much faster than using a physical computer
* [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/) - This is used to assemble the assembly to machine code from our slightly more human readable set of instructions we are giving the computer.
