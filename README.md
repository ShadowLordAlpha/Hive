# Hive

I always thought it would be an interesting project to create my own OS even if it was simple. While looking around online for resources about this nearly everywhere basically boiled down to "don't do it", "just use/modify *nix", "it's possible but really hard so don't". That is of course a generalization of quite a lot of different comments I found in a number of places. I did find a few good places but one of the best was [Writing a Simple Operating System â€”from Scratch](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf) by Nick Blundell.

I have always learned best by doing and then making my own version of the instructions I followed or something similar (read it, learn it, teach it) so for whatever reason I decided to put this up on GitHub

## But why...

Like I said above, I thought it would be a cool and interesting project. I also wanted to see if I could get far enough to begin implementing whatever random ideas I would eventually think of. There is a reason this repository is called Hive after all. Also all the current OS' we have started somewhere.

## How to use

Each numbered folder will build on the previous folder. Just follow them in order and it should be decently logical.
